Generated with ChatGPT to make quippy Wheatley one liners, including speech control from https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech.

Then used https://fish.audio/app/text-to-speech/?modelId=22d3371f97654209ba62b25881a3c1b3 to generate the speech. Chatterbox TTS is pretty good too (https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox)

Kind of a proof of concept but rather hilarious.

Copy the wav files to /opt/rockrobo/resources/sounds/en/ on your roborock and it will play those back
